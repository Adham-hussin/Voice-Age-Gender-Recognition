# Voice Age Gender Recognition

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for recognizing speaker gender and age based on voice signals. Given an audio file, the system classifies it into one of four categories:

- **0**: Male, Twenties
- **1**: Female, Twenties
- **2**: Male, Fifties
- **3**: Female, Fifties

## Features
- Audio preprocessing to handle background noise, volume variations, and different speaking speeds.
- Feature extraction for effective voice classification.
- Machine learning model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Usage
The project will provide scripts for training, inference, and evaluation. More details will be added as development progresses.

## Requirements
A list of dependencies and setup instructions will be included soon.
